              I chose this website because it is an important tool for people
              who are looking for a dentistry or who are looking to find out
              more information from their current dentistry. However, this site
              looks outdated which will discourage some users from looking
              further into this dentistry. In addition, the site doesn’t respond
              well to page changes and doesn’t have a mobile view which
              alienates many users from being able to use it. Finally, this site
              does not take up much space on the page, and has small text, which
              makes it hard to read and engage with.

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          To prepare to redesign this website, I first did an activity called
          speed sketching where I divided a sheet of paper into 9 squares and
          over the course of 9 minutes, I created 9 possible redesigns. This
          process allowed me to brainstorm without worrying about if each design
          is fleshed-out enough; rather, I was able to play with different
          formats and ideas and see what I liked for when putting together my
          final sketch and wireframe.

      <div>
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I created a low-fidelity wireframe, one for desktop, one for
          tablet, and one for mobile. In addition, I annotated each wireframe to
          specify why I made each change or why I kept things the same as the
          original site.
        </p>
        <div id="low-fid-wireframes">
          <img
            class="low-fidelity"
            src="/assets/desktop-wireframe.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <img class="low-fidelity" src="/assets/tablet-wireframe.png" alt="" />
          <img class="low-fidelity" src="/assets/mobile-wireframe.png" alt="" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
          After creating low-fidelity wireframes, I began to put together a
          style guide for the website redesign. I knew that I wanted to give the
          website a similar feel to the original site, so to do this, I took
          into account the logo colors and website colors while also making new
          choises for font, icons, and colors. I learned a lot through this
          process figuring out what works in the final code, especially learning
          how accessible certain colors are.
        </p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>
            I used the dark blue from the logo as part of my color palette then
            used a color palette generator to put together a light shade of blue
            and a medium shade of blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the fonts, I chose Lato and Gothic A1 for their simplicity and
            readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used Font Awesome for my icon library, which allowed me to find
            icons that fit the function of each of the buttons they are used
            for.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initially, I had chosen a lighter blue for the main blue color of
            this redesign, but through testing with WEBAIM, I learned that there
            was not enough contrast, so I changed the style guide to reflect a
            deeper shade of blue that allows for better contrast when white text
            is on it.
          </li>
        </ul>
