      <h1>Responsive Redesign Case Study: Compassionate Dentistry</h1>
      <p id="heading-paragraph">
        What does it mean to redesign a website? I undertook this question by
        exploring the workflow of redesigning a website through brainstorming,
        sketching, wireframing, and coding!
      </p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <div>
        <h2>Usability Problems</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div>
            <p>
              First, I chose the website that I wanted to design. I chose this
              dentistry website because it is an important tool for people who
              are looking for a dentistry or who are looking to find out more
              information from their current dentistry. Having easy to use,
              accessible interfaces is vital for websites pertaining to
              medecine. <br />
              <br />
              However, this site looks outdated which will discourage some users
              from looking further into this dentistry. In addition, the site
              doesn’t respond well to page size changes and doesn’t have a
              mobile view which alienates many users from being able to use it.
              Finally, this site does not utilize the full space of the page and
              has small text, which makes it hard to read and engage with.
              <br /><br />See below for the link to the original site:
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.goodteeth.com/">https://www.goodteeth.com/</a>
          </div>
          <img
            id="goodteeth"
            class="center"
            src="./assets/original-page.png"
            alt="Screenshot of goodteeth website"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          To prepare to redesign this website, I first did an activity called
          speed sketching where I divided a sheet of paper into 9 squares. Over
          the course of 9 minutes, I created 9 possible redesigns. This process
          allowed me to brainstorm without worrying about if each design is
          fleshed-out enough; rather, I was able to play with different formats
          and ideas and see what I liked for when putting together my final
          sketch and wireframe. Using the ideas generated from speed sketching,
          I created my final sketch which I then based my wireframes off of.
        </p>
        <div id="image-holder">
          <div class="half">
            <h3>Speed Sketches</h3>
            <!-- <div> -->
            <img
              class="sketch rotate"
              src="./assets/speed-sketching1.png"
              alt="speed-sketching1"
            />
            <!-- <img
                class="sketch rotate"
                src="./assets/speed-sketching2.png"
                alt="speed-sketching2"
              /> -->
            <!-- </div> -->
          </div>
          <div class="half">
            <h3>Final Sketch</h3>
            <img
              class="sketch"
              src="./assets/final-sketch.png"
              alt="Final Initial Sketch for Redesign"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I created low-fidelity wireframes: one for desktop, one for
          tablet, and one for mobile. In addition, I annotated each wireframe to
          specify why I made each change or why I kept things the same as the
          original site. The most notable changes I made were ensuring that the
          content took up the full width of the page and creating a view
          specifically for mobile, both of which the original site did not do.
        </p>
        <div id="low-fid-wireframes">
          <img
            class="low-fidelity"
            src="./assets/desktop-wireframe.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <img
            class="low-fidelity"
            src="./assets/tablet-wireframe.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <img
            class="low-fidelity"
            src="./assets/mobile-wireframe.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
          After creating low-fidelity wireframes, I began to put together a
          style guide for the website redesign. I knew that I wanted to give the
          website a similar feel to the original site. To do this, I took into
          account the logo colors and website colors while also making new
          choises for font, icons, and some other colors.
        </p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>
            I used the green and dark blue from the logo as part of my color
            palette then added white. I used a color palette generator to put
            together a light shade of blue and a medium shade of blue to create
            the full palette.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the fonts, I chose Lato and Gothic A1 for their simplicity and
            readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used Font Awesome for my icon library, which allowed me to find
            icons that fit the function of each of the buttons in this website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initially, I had chosen a lighter blue for the main blue color of
            this redesign, but through testing with WEBAIM, I learned that there
            was not enough contrast, so I changed the style guide to reflect a
            deeper shade of blue that allows for better contrast when white text
            is on it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img class="center" src="./assets/style-guide.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>High-Fidelity Mockup</h2>
        <p>
          After creating a style guide, I created three high-fidelity mockups
          based on my wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile. When creating
          the website in HTML and CSS, I used these mockups and the style guide
          for guidance and reference.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="third column">

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, I learned the full workflow of creating a
          redesign for a website, from brainstorming to a final front-end
          product. This process taught me the importance of and skills for
          designing with a user in mind, applying design principles, and coding
          a responsive site. <br /><br />For this site in particular because it
          relates to healthcare, having a clear website that works on a variety
          of devices is extremely important to reach as many people as possible.
          By incorporating features such as contrasting colors, HTML5 semantic
          elements, and descriptive alt tags for images, my redesign aims to
          enhance user experience and ensure that the site is accessible to a
          diverse audience. <br /><br />The skills acquired during this project
          are vital going forward to allow me to confidently approach any future
          project and have a comprehensive understanding of how the elements of
          the design process help to produce effective outcomes.
