        <p>
          I chose this website because it is an important tool for people who
          are looking for a dentistry or who are looking to find out more
          information from their current dentistry. However, this site looks
          outdated which will discourage some users from looking further into
          this dentistry. In addition, the site doesn’t respond well to page
          changes and doesn’t have a mobile view which alienates many users from
          being able to use it. Finally, this site does not take up much space
          on the page, and has small text, which makes it hard to read and
          engage with.

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          To prepare to redesign this website, I first prepared did an activity
          called speed sketching where I divided a sheet of paper into 9 squares
          and over the course of 9 minutes, I created 9 possible redesigns. This
          process allowed me to brainstorm without worrying about if each design
          is fleshed-out enough; rather, I was able to play with different
          formats and ideas and see what I liked for when putting together my
          final sketch and wireframe.

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I created a low-fidelity wireframe, one for desktop, one for
          tablet, and one for mobile. In addition, I annotated each wireframe to
          specify why I made each change or why I kept things the same as the
          original site.
